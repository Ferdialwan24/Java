#  Word Count 

This is a Java program I've developed for a word count challenge. It provides functionality to perform various counting operations on a text file.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need:

- Java installed on your computer.
- Download the ccwc.java file from this repository.
- Prepare .txt files for testing purposes. Ensure they are in the same directory as ccwc.java.

## Instructions

Follow these steps:

1. *Open the Program*: Open the ccwc.java with programming software:
2. *Run the Program*: Execute the compiled Java program:
3. *View the Output*: The program will display terminal output to enter the name of the text file you want to analyze and the counting operation you want to perform (-c, -l, or -w). After providing the input, the program will display the result.

The program supports four options for counting operations:

- -c : Counts the number of bytes in the file.
- -l: Counts the number of lines in the file.
- -w: Counts the number of words in the file.
